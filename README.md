# OpenGL2 & WinAPI demo
My little 3d-ish graphics demo with spinning cubic planets and moons.

Made with OpenGL 2 and WinAPI for context handling ( yes, pretty outdated ).
Open project with CodeBlocks, and it should compile out of the box. 
Works only for windows, cause of WinAPI.

( 27/09/2021 ) I am currently leaning GLFW and modern OpenGL ( >=3.3 ) from the book,
and I will definetely remake this soon, so it will be compatible with all systems, and the code
will just look prettier.
